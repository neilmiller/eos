Basic instructions for usage of h5table

The core code here is h5table.f


ideal_water.f : Provides a simple ideal gas law equation of state for water.
  ig_get_f : (Rho, T) -> (F)
  convDF_thermo : (Rho, T, F) -> (P, E, S)
  ig_get_val : (Rho, T) -> (P, E, S)

write_idealgas_tbl.f : Uses the ideal_water.f to generate a table that can be read by the h5table module

h5table.f : Defines the h5table module
   setup_h5tbl - sets up the memory & reads the input file
   free_h5tbl - frees the memory
   h5_get_val - (Rho, T) -> (P, E, S)

test_idealh5.f : Uses the h5table generated by "write_idealgas_tbl.f" and compares the resulting values from 
   h5_get_val to the original values generated by ig_get_val
